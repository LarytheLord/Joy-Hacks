# Joy Hacks - Docker

This directory contains Docker configuration for the code execution sandbox used in the Joy Hacks social media platform.

## Structure

```

├── languages/              # Language-specific Docker configurations
│   ├── python/             # Python execution environment
│   ├── javascript/         # JavaScript execution environment
│   └── cpp/                # C++ execution environment

└── scripts/                # Utility scripts for Docker management
```

## Features

- Isolated code execution environments
- Support for multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C++)
- Resource limitations to prevent abuse
- Security measures to prevent malicious code execution
- API for code submission and result retrieval

## Security Considerations

- All code execution happens in isolated containers
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time)
- Network access restrictions
- File system isolation
- User code never runs on the host machine

## Development

Instructions for setting up the Docker environments will be added as the project progresses.
